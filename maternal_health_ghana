#  Ghana Maternal Health Risk Predictor

##  The Problem
Ghana faces significant maternal health challenges:
- **308 maternal deaths** per 100,000 live births (WHO)
- **42% of pregnant women** suffer from anemia
- **16 regions** with vast healthcare access disparities
- Rural communities often far from health facilities

##  The Solution
A Linear Regression model (built from scratch) that predicts maternal health risk scores to help identify high-risk pregnancies early.

##  Model Performance
| Metric | Your Model | Sklearn Comparison |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| **Training R²** | 0.7843 | - |
| **Testing R²** | **0.8045** | **0.8551** |
| **Testing MAE** | ±5.46 points | ±4.73 points |
| **Baseline MAE** | ±13.36 points | - |
| **Improvement** | **2.4x better** than guessing | - |

##  Features Used
- **Age** of mother (15-49 years)
- **Blood pressure** (systolic)
- **Hemoglobin levels** (anemia indicator)
- **Number of previous pregnancies**
- **Distance to health facility** (km)
- **Nutrition score** (0-10)
- **Education level** (0-3: None, Primary, Secondary, Tertiary)
- **Region** (all 16 regions of Ghana)

##  Visualizations


### Regional Healthcare Access
![Healthcare Access by Region](ghana_16_regions_access.png)
*Average distance to health facilities across Ghana's 16 regions. Northern regions show significantly poorer access.*

### Model Performance

### Risk Distribution

*Maternal health risk scores across regions*

##  Key Insights
1. **Northern regions** (Savannah, North East, Upper East) show 2-3x higher risk scores than Greater Accra
2. **Hemoglobin levels** are the strongest predictor of maternal risk
3. **Distance to healthcare** is critical - each 10km increases risk by ~7 points
4. **Education** is protective - tertiary education reduces risk by 5-8 points
5. **Anemia prevalence** is 2x higher in northern regions

##  Technical Implementation
- **Pure Python + NumPy** implementation of Linear Regression
- **Gradient descent** from scratch (2000 iterations)
- **One-hot encoding** for categorical regions
- **Feature scaling** with StandardScaler
- **No black-box ML libraries** for core algorithm
